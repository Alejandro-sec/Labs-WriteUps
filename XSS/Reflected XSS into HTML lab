# Reflected XSS in HTML Context (Nothing Encoded) — PortSwigger Lab

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Platform / Source:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy — Lab "Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded"
**Host / URL:** https://0aae00070401c60a805b0375008100c8.web-security-academy.net/
**Level:** Beginner

## Summary
During the lab, I identified a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)** vulnerability in the `search` parameter. Injecting a JavaScript payload into the query string resulted in execution within the document context, as demonstrated by a browser alert.

## Scope and Authorization
The tests were performed exclusively on the lab instance provided by PortSwigger. No tests were performed on external systems or in production environments.

## Reconnaissance
Initially, I inspected the lab blog interface to locate entry points. Finding no immediate evidence in the main URL, I checked the site's search box and confirmed that the form was sending the `search` parameter using GET.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

- **Method:** GET
- **Affected Parameter:** `search` (query string)
- **Payload Used:**
```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
